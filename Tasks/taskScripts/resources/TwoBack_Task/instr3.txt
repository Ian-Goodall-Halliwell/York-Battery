For example, if the images were of letters, suppose you were presented an image of the letter 'K'.
If the order of the images leading up to it were as follows: 'L'	''K''	 'M'	Current image: ''K''
then you would press the right arrow key, since the letter 'K' was also presented two images before the current 'K'.
If the order of the images were: ['L', 'M', ''K'', ''K''] or [''K'', 'L', 'M', ''K''] or ['J', 'L', 'M', ''K'']
then you would press the left arrow key upon seeing the 'K', since there was no 'K' two images before the current one.
